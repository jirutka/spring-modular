Spring Modular [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jirutka/spring-modular.png)](https://travis-ci.org/jirutka/spring-modular)
==============

The aim of this project is to make [Spring](http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/)-based applications more modular, but without complexity and problems of OSGi. This solution is very simple, it basically enhances Springâ€™s context hierarchy model by adding ability to explicitly export and import beans between child contexts (aka modules).
